# OpenExplorerPHP
A fast and lightweight file manager using SQLite.

## The idea
&hellip; is to create a simple and universal file explorer&nbsp;&ndash; the less complex, the better.
Any user directory is virtualized by the database and all files are stored in a user-specific folder.

## Please.
Do not hesitate and point out flaws and possible improvements. Thanks in advance!

## Installation
1. Make sure you have a fully functioning (Apache HTTP 2.4) webserver with PHP &#x2265; 5.6 and SQLite3 installed.
2. You will need the following PHP extensions: ```ctype```, ```intl```, ```json```, ```mbstring```, ```pdo```.
You can manage them with Composer or install them manually (and activate them in ```php.ini```).
3. If everything is up and running, you may try to run ```setupdb.php``` to initialize the database under ```./db/```.
4. That's it. Go to the standard port of your localhost/register.php, and you can start to manage your files!
5. The standard test user is ```qwertz``` with the password ```12345```.

You can (de-) activate Developer Mode in ```folder.js``` at the top and look at the console output.

## Disclaimers
### Post-installation and customization
You can customize your version of OpenExplorerPHP.
1. Manage the allowed filetypes in ```app/globals.php```. At the end of the file is an array, where you can add
the MIME-types of all the files you wish to permit on your server. *It is currently very limited!*
2. In your PHP settings, increase the maximum upload filesize. To achieve this, you normally modify the
```php.ini``` file and search for ```upload_max_filesize```. Sometimes, you also need to update your server's settings.
And while you're on it, you can look into increasing ```post_max_size``` and ```max_execution_time``` too.
I have them on 24 and 300 respectively.
3. Change your directory path in ```data/.htaccess```: This file prevents anyone from seeing files per link that
they are not the owners of. But for this to work, you need to update the path in line 10 in the following way:
```RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}:/[Path to the project's root]/data/%{ENV:user_id_folder}/ ...```.

### Support for Firefox
Currently, the application *does not work at all* in Firefox. This is due to their missing implementation of
the CSS ```:has()``` pseudo-class (needed for the theme selection) and the JavaScript import assertions
(needed for the import of ```i18n.json```).

That's it!
